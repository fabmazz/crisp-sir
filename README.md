# Sibyl-team implementation


This package contains an implementation of the CRISP method (see below the paper) for the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model instead of the SEIR model of the original paper, which is available in the [CRISP repository](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/CRISP)

## Install

Simply do
```
pip install .
```

Only `numpy` and `numba` are required for the code to run.
